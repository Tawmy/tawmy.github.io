          I'm incredibly torn on this. Definitely has its moments and fun throughout, but misses the mark in certain regards. Excited for S2 though.
          <br><br>Good: Understanding of MMORPGs, depth, conflict of game vs reality<br><br>Bad: Silliness, many bland characters, no real overall story/conflict

          It's amazing how Makoto Shinkai managed to fit so much story, so many emotions into 25 minutes. Showing its age, but very good nontheless.
          <br><br>"Showing its age" is not that great of a description. The animation just isn't good to begin with. This is just secondary to the story tho.

          Stunningly beautiful movie with a touching story. This story wanted to be so much more than they could fit into 1.5 hours, sadly.
          <br><br>Multiple aspects of the story just ended to be scratched upon, were not elaborated on and just didn't quite fit in. Still very good tho.
          <br><br>So for what they could fit into this time, they did quite well, but it really, really needed more time than that.

          There is no way for me to put my thoughts on Clannad: After story into 140 characters. Truly breathtaking.
          <br><br>This anime has reached rank #12 on MAL not because of its animation, action or thrilling story. Those do not play a part in this story. Solely the characters' past, present, future, their character development and growth, the obstacles they face, make up this beautiful story.
          <br><br>It is certainly the most touching, heartwarming, but also heartbreaking and truly soul-crushing story I have ever experienced.
